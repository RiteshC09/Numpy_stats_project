# Numpy_stats_project

Project Description:
This project is a Python-based mini statistical analysis engine designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It provides reusable methods to compute key descriptive and inferential statistics for numerical datasets using NumPy and Python’s statistics module.
The project aims to bridge statistical theory with practical Python implementation.

🧠 Objectives
1)Apply core statistical concepts programmatically
2)Build reusable, class-based analytical methods
3)Perform dataset comparison and relationship analysis
4)Strengthen NumPy and OOP fundamentals
